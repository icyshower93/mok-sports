- No stale instance reuse - fresh connection for each draft transition
- Enhanced draft change detection with connection cleanup

**âœ… FIX #2: Server Memory & Port Reuse Protection** 
- Server restart detection with stale state cleanup
- Connection tracking reset on first connection after restart
- Draft state cleanup prevents timer loop conflicts
- Memory leak prevention for abandoned connections

- âœ… **Redis Persistence**: Timers survive server restarts and maintain countdown accuracy
- âœ… **Auto-Pick System**: Timer expiration triggers automatic picks and advances to next player
- âœ… **Production Ready**: All timer scenarios work for current and future drafts
- âœ… **API Synchronization**: Frontend displays live countdown instead of stuck at 0:00
- âœ… **WebSocket Enhancement**: PERMANENT FIX implemented for connection issues after server restarts

**SEAMLESS RESET-TO-DRAFT WEBSOCKET CONNECTION** (August 6, 2025):
- âœ… **Enhanced Reset API**: Creates new draft instead of clearing old one for clean WebSocket connection
- âœ… **Smart Reset Button**: Automatic navigation to new draft room with cache invalidation
- âœ… **WebSocket Draft Validation**: Validates draft existence before connection attempts
- âœ… **Draft Change Detection**: Handles draft changes automatically with old connection cleanup
- âœ… **Complete Workflow**: 1-click Reset â†’ New Draft â†’ Auto Navigation â†’ WebSocket Connection
- âœ… **PRODUCTION VERIFIED**: WebSocket connects instantly on replit.app with SSL, ping-pong heartbeat working
- âœ… **CONNECTION SUCCESS**: User confirmed WebSocket connecting perfectly to wss://mok-sports-draft-mokfantasysport.replit.app

**Draft Reset System IMPLEMENTED**: Complete reset functionality ensures reliable testing:
- âœ… All draft picks cleared and reset to Round 1, Pick 1
- âœ… Fresh 60-second timer starts for first user automatically
- âœ… Enhanced API endpoint `/api/testing/reset-draft` for comprehensive resets
- âœ… Timer system recovery working correctly after server restarts

**Timer Flow CONFIRMED WORKING**: Complete verification of core requirements:
- âœ… Each user gets exactly 60 seconds per pick
- âœ… Manual picks advance to next user with fresh 60-second timer
- âœ… Auto-picks (when timer expires) advance to next user with fresh 60-second timer
- âœ… Seamless progression through all rounds and picks
- âœ… Backend timer logging shows live countdown in server console
- âœ… **API Data Accuracy**: Real-time timer data perfectly synchronized between backend and API

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The client-side application is built with React 18 and TypeScript, using hooks and functional components. The UI framework leverages `shadcn/ui` components, built on `Radix UI primitives` and styled with `Tailwind CSS`. `Wouter` is used for lightweight client-side routing. State management, caching, and data fetching are handled by `TanStack Query (React Query)`. `Vite` serves as the build tool, providing fast hot module replacement and optimized production builds. Styling employs custom CSS variables for a comprehensive design system with light/dark theme support and a custom color palette.

## Backend Architecture

The server is built with Express.js using TypeScript, following a modular architecture with ESM modules. `Passport.js` with Google OAuth2 strategy handles user authentication, using JWT tokens stored as HTTP-only cookies for session management. `Drizzle ORM` provides type-safe database operations with `PostgreSQL`, configured with the `Neon serverless PostgreSQL` adapter. API design is RESTful, including comprehensive error handling and request/response logging.

### Production-Ready Scaling Improvements (Latest)
- **Redis State Management**: Draft state and timers persist using Redis with in-memory fallback for development
- **Enhanced JWT Authentication**: Improved token validation with Bearer header support for PWA compatibility
- **Database Connection Pooling**: Optimized PostgreSQL connections with health monitoring and connection limits
- **Health Check Endpoints**: `/api/health` endpoint for monitoring database, Redis, and overall system health
- **Static Asset Optimization**: Proper MIME type serving and cache headers for production deployment
- **Upstash Redis Integration**: Successfully connected to Upstash Redis for persistent state management across server restarts
- **Critical MIME Type Fix**: Resolved JavaScript assets returning HTML instead of JS - static assets now served before Vite middleware with correct Content-Type headers

### Real-Time Draft System
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time draft synchronization using WebSocket connections on `/ws/draft` path
- **Snake Draft Manager**: Comprehensive draft logic with timer management, auto-pick functionality, and conference rule validation
- **State Persistence**: Draft state persists across page reloads and reconnections with automatic timer restoration
- **Robot Testing System**: 4 automated bot users (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta Bot) for comprehensive draft testing
- **Timer Recovery**: Enhanced timer system with immediate expiration handling and server restart resilience
- **React Error #310 Resolved**: Fixed critical Rules of Hooks violations where useEffect was called after conditional returns (January 4, 2025)

### Testing Infrastructure  
- **Draft Reset Functionality**: Complete draft state reset for iterative testing
- **Robot User Management**: Automated addition/removal of bot users to leagues
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: WebSocket connection status tracking and automatic reconnection
- **Timer Diagnostics**: Real-time timer monitoring and manual intervention capabilities for testing
- **Draft Order Verification**: 6-user snake draft order: Beta Bot â†’ Mok Sports â†’ Delta Bot â†’ Alpha Bot â†’ Gamma Bot â†’ Sky Evans

## Data Storage Solutions

The primary database is PostgreSQL, hosted on the Neon serverless platform. User sessions are managed via JWT tokens in HTTP-only cookies. The schema includes a users table with Google OAuth integration, timestamps, and UUID primary keys.

## Authentication and Authorization

Google OAuth2 is the primary authentication mechanism. JWT tokens use secure signing, and cookies are configured with `httpOnly`, `secure` (in production), and `sameSite` flags for security. New users are automatically registered upon their first Google login.
