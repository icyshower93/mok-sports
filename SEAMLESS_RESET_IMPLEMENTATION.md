# Seamless Reset-to-Draft WebSocket Implementation

## Problem Solved
Previously, when users clicked the reset button, the WebSocket would try to reconnect to a deleted draft, causing connection failures and requiring manual navigation.

## Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Reset API (`/api/testing/reset-draft`)
- **Input**: `leagueId` instead of `draftId` 
- **Process**:
  - Deletes existing draft and all related data (picks, timers)
  - Creates fresh new draft with new UUID
  - Automatically starts timer for first user
  - Returns new `draftId` for navigation

### 2. Smart Reset Button (DraftControls)
- **Auto-Navigation**: Automatically navigates to new draft room after reset
- **UI Feedback**: Shows "New draft created with fresh timer. Joining draft room..."
- **Cache Invalidation**: Clears all relevant React Query caches
- **1-second Delay**: Allows backend to fully initialize before navigation

### 3. Enhanced WebSocket Connection Logic
- **Draft Change Detection**: Detects when draftId changes (reset scenario)
- **Old Connection Cleanup**: Closes previous WebSocket connections
- **Draft Validation**: Validates draft exists before attempting connection
- **Auto-Connection**: Automatically connects to new draft after reset
- **Status Tracking**: Proper status updates including 'draft_not_found'

## User Flow
1. User clicks reset button (ðŸ”„) in league waiting room
2. System deletes old draft and creates new one
3. User automatically navigates to new draft room
4. WebSocket immediately connects to new draft
5. Timer starts for first user seamlessly

## Technical Benefits
- âœ… **Zero Manual Steps**: Complete automation from reset to active draft
- âœ… **Immediate Connection**: WebSocket connects instantly to new draft  
- âœ… **Clean State**: No leftover connections or cached data
- âœ… **Error Prevention**: Draft validation prevents connection to deleted drafts
- âœ… **Robust Handling**: Graceful handling of all edge cases

## Files Modified
- `server/routes.ts`: Enhanced reset API 
- `client/src/components/draft-controls.tsx`: Reset button with auto-navigation
- `client/src/hooks/use-draft-websocket.ts`: Enhanced connection logic

## Verification Status
âœ… Reset API creates new drafts successfully
âœ… WebSocket validation logic implemented
âœ… Auto-navigation functionality added
âœ… Enhanced error handling for all scenarios

The system now provides a completely seamless reset â†’ new draft â†’ WebSocket connection workflow.
