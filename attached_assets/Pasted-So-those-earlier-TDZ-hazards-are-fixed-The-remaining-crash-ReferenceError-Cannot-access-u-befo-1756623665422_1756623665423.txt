So those earlier TDZ hazards are fixed. The remaining crash:

ReferenceError: Cannot access 'u' before initialization
… at hx (index-*.js:402:152600)


is a different TDZ elsewhere. The u is just a minified name; we need to map it back to the real file+line to squash it.

Here’s the quickest way to do that (copy/paste ready).

1) Build with source maps (and make names readable)

In your project root:

# turn on sourcemaps, and keep original function/class names for clearer stacks
# (Vite uses esbuild to minify; keepNames makes stacks much nicer.)
# One-time tweak to vite.config.ts:

// export default defineConfig({
export default defineConfig({
  esbuild: { keepNames: true },   // <-- add this
  build: { sourcemap: true },     // <-- ensure sourcemaps
  // ...rest of your config
})


Then build:

npx vite build --mode production


(For an even easier first pass, you can also do npx vite build --mode production --sourcemap --minify=false once; that often makes the error say the real identifier instead of u.)

2) Map the stack frame(s) to original TS/TSX

Add this tiny script once:

npm i -D @jridgewell/trace-mapping


Create scripts/map-stack.mjs:

import fs from "fs";
import { TraceMap, originalPositionFor } from "@jridgewell/trace-mapping";

const [, , mapFile, ...pairs] = process.argv;
if (!mapFile || pairs.length === 0) {
  console.error("Usage: node scripts/map-stack.mjs <path-to-map> <line:col> [line:col...]");
  process.exit(1);
}

const map = new TraceMap(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(mapFile, "utf8")));

for (const pair of pairs) {
  const [lineStr, colStr] = pair.split(":");
  const line = Number(lineStr);
  const column = Number(colStr);
  const pos = originalPositionFor(map, { line, column });
  console.log(`${pair} ->`, pos);
}


Run it with the line:column numbers from your console:

node scripts/map-stack.mjs \
  dist/public/assets/index-CIcHM6EX.js.map \
  402:152600 40:34207 38:16998


You’ll get outputs like:

402:152600 -> { source: "client/src/pages/XYZ.tsx", line: 123, column: 17, name: "realIdentifier" }


Open that file at that line — that’s the actual throw site.

3) Fix patterns (what you’re looking for on that line)

A TDZ “Cannot access ‘<name>’ before initialization” in React apps is almost always one of:

Same-file order issue
e.g.

const a = () => b();   // ← uses b
const b = () => a();   // ← b isn’t initialized when a runs


✅ Fix: convert one to a function declaration (which hoists), or reorder so the callee is defined first, or break the recursion.

Hook used in a callback/conditional
e.g. useQueryClient() called inside onSuccess or inside if (...) instead of at the top.
✅ Fix: hoist const queryClient = useQueryClient(); to the top of the component and use that reference everywhere.

Circular imports (module A imports B while B imports A)
Symptoms: top-level const/let in one file reads a value from the other during module init.
✅ Fix: break the cycle. Options:

Import concrete submodules instead of a barrel index.ts.

Move shared constants/types into a new tiny module …/shared.ts.

Convert one top-level usage to a lazy use (e.g., move it inside a function/effect so it runs after both modules have initialized).

As a test, replace import {...} from "@/foo" with const mod = await import("@/foo") inside the function that needs it. If the TDZ disappears, you’ve confirmed it’s an import cycle.

4) Two quick grep checks (to catch common offenders)

Run these in the repo root:

# Any inline hook uses (should be zero)
rg -n "useQueryClient\\(\\)\\." client/src

# Any dependency arrays touching queryClient (make sure each file declares it)
rg -n "\\[(?:[^\\]]*\\bqueryClient\\b[^\\]]*)\\]" client/src


Everything I saw in your zip passes these now.
