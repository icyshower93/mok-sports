Mok Sports — How to Play
1. League Setup & Draft
Join a 6-player league and draft 5 NFL teams each.

The draft pool has all 32 NFL teams. 30 teams are drafted, 2 remain as free agents.

Draft order is randomized and uses a snake format.

You can’t pick more than one team from the same division unless it’s unavoidable.

Trading draft picks is not allowed — trades happen only after the draft using free agent teams.

2. Weekly Gameplay & Scoring
Each week, your 5 teams play their real NFL games (not all teams play every week).

Your teams earn Mok points based on game outcomes:

Win: +1 point

Tie: +0.5 point

Blowout: +1 point (win by 20+ points)

Shutout: +1 point (hold opponent to 0 points)

Highest scoring team that week: +1 point

Lowest scoring team that week: –1 point per team tied for lowest

Points add up across all your teams each week.

If a team has a bye or their game is canceled, they score 0 points (no penalty).

3. Locks & Lock and Load — Boost Your Score!
Before Thursday’s first game each week, pick one team from your stable to “Lock.”

Locked teams must have a game that week.

If your locked team wins, you earn +1 bonus lock point. Ties or losses get no bonus.

You can lock each team up to 4 times per season.

Once per team per season, you can “Lock and Load” instead of a normal lock.

Lock and Load means +2 bonus points for a win, –1 point if they lose, and 0 points for a tie.

Lock and Load stacks on your regular lock — you must lock to lock and load.

Locks and Lock and Load usage stay with the team even if traded.

Miss the lock deadline? No lock points that week. Locks open again Monday night after the last game.

4. Trades & Free Agents — Switch Up Your Stable
You can trade one team from your stable for one of the 2 free agent teams each week.

Trades only happen between Monday night (after the last game) and Thursday morning (before the first game).

You can only make one trade per week.

When you pick up a free agent team, you must lock that team for the upcoming week.

Keep your free agent team for at least one week before trading again.

Locks and Lock and Load availability move with teams; if a team with no locks left goes to free agents, it resets to 1 lock for the new owner.

5. Payouts & Skins — Win Real Rewards
Each week, the player with the highest total Mok points wins a “skin” (a cash prize).

If there’s a tie for the weekly win, no skins are awarded and the prize rolls over — doubling the next week’s payout. Skins can keep stacking this way!

Season-long rewards go to:

Player with the most Mok points over the entire regular season.

Player with the Super Bowl-winning team in their stable at season’s end.

Player with the most correct locks (including Lock and Load) throughout the season.

Ties for season prizes split the payout evenly.

6. Season & Timing
The season follows the NFL’s regular season schedule.

Mok Sports scoring and payouts end after the regular season; playoffs don’t count except for the Super Bowl prize.

All deadlines and game times follow the NFL schedule.

The Mok Sports system enforces rules, lock deadlines, and trade windows automatically.

Quick Tips
Always lock a team before Thursday’s first game to earn bonus points!

Use Lock and Load wisely — it’s high risk, high reward.

Keep an eye on free agents — trading strategically can boost your stable.

Remember, low-scoring teams hurt your total Mok points! Avoid teams likely to score lowest.

Stacking skins can lead to big payouts, so plan your locks carefully.
