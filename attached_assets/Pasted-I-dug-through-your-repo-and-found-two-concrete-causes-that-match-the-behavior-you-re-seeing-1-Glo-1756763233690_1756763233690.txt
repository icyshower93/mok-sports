I dug through your repo and found two concrete causes that match the behavior you’re seeing:

1) Global redirect hook is hijacking tab navigation

File: client/src/hooks/useSmartRedirect.ts
Right now useSmartRedirect runs from the AuthProvider for every page (see client/src/features/auth/AuthProvider.tsx, it calls useSmartRedirect(isAuthenticated && !!user && !isLoading)), and the hook’s logic sends you back to / whenever there’s no active or idle draft:

// useSmartRedirect.ts (current)
else {
  // No draft or completed draft - go to main app (scores, teams, etc.)
  console.log('[SmartRedirect] No active/idle draft found, going to main app');
  startTransition(() => {
    setLocation("/");
  });
}


That means when you click Teams/Scores/More, the hook immediately yanks you back to Home (/). That’s exactly why all tabs appear “broken” after draft completion.

Minimal fix (don’t hijack real tabs)

Only bump the user to / if they’re on a pre-draft page (dashboard/league screens). Otherwise, let them stay on the tab they chose:

 // useSmartRedirect.ts
- else {
-   // No draft or completed draft - go to main app (scores, teams, etc.)
-   console.log('[SmartRedirect] No active/idle draft found, going to main app');
-   startTransition(() => {
-     setLocation("/");
-   });
- }
+ else {
+   // No active/idle draft.
+   // If the user is on pre-draft screens, bump them to the main app.
+   // Otherwise, do not hijack normal navigation (scores/teams/more/etc).
+   if (location === "/dashboard" || location.startsWith("/league")) {
+     console.log("[SmartRedirect] Completed/no draft; leaving guarded page -> /");
+     startTransition(() => setLocation("/"));
+   } else {
+     console.log("[SmartRedirect] Completed/no draft; staying on", location);
+   }
+ }


If you prefer stricter control, you can also only run useSmartRedirect on landing contexts. In AuthProvider.tsx, gate it by path:

import { useLocation } from "wouter";
const [loc] = useLocation();
const enableSmart = isAuthenticated && !!user && !isLoading &&
  (loc === "/" || loc === "/dashboard" || loc.startsWith("/league") || loc.startsWith("/draft"));
useSmartRedirect(enableSmart);


That keeps the smart routing at app entry/leagues/draft, but never when the user is inside the regular app tabs.
