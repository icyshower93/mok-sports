Redesign the Home tab of the Mok Sports fantasy football PWA to look professional, modern, and data-rich—similar in quality and polish to Sleeper and ESPN Fantasy mobile apps.

Overall Style & Layout:

Mobile-first, responsive design with card-based layout, subtle shadows, and rounded corners (2xl) for all cards.

Use team colors and subtle gradients where appropriate, but keep the overall theme consistent with our brand palette.

Typography: bold, clean headlines for section titles, smaller text for stats, and clear labels.

Spacing: at least p-4 padding inside all sections for readability.

Sticky top app bar with the league name and user avatar on the right.

Scrollable vertical layout with clear section separation and consistent margins.

Sections & Requirements
User Statistics Card (Top of screen)

Large, visually appealing card that shows:

Total Season Points (large number, bold)

Current League Rank (e.g., "2nd out of 6")

Skins Won (e.g., "4 skins this season")

Use icons for each stat (e.g., trophy for rank, target for skins).

Slight gradient background or team color accent.

Weekly Skins Ranking

Horizontal scroll list showing the current week’s top players in the skins game.

Each player card: small avatar, name, points, and a crown icon for first place.

Section title: “This Week’s Skins Leaders” with a “View All” link.

Games Today

Small schedule section showing NFL games happening today.

Each row: team logos, matchup (e.g., "NE vs BUF"), start time, and maybe point spread.

If no games today, show "No games scheduled today" message.

News Section

“League & NFL News” header.

2–3 news cards showing latest updates from the NFL or league announcements.

Each card: image thumbnail, headline, and short snippet.

“View All News” link at the bottom.

Activity Feed

Recent events in the league: e.g., “John won this week’s skins”, “Sarah is now in 1st place”, “Mike updated payouts”.

List format with small user avatars and timestamps.

Clickable to expand into full league activity page.

UI Inspiration References
Sleeper: Card-based stats layout, playful but modern color accents, clean spacing.

ESPN Fantasy: Clear typography, section separation, and data hierarchy.

Yahoo Fantasy: Simple but information-rich dashboard.

Technical Implementation Notes
Use Tailwind CSS for styling with grid and flex layouts.

Use shadcn/ui components for cards, tabs, and avatars.

Optimize for PWA with smooth scrolling and lightweight assets.

Consider lazy-loading images for news & games.

Each card should be independently clickable to drill into details.
