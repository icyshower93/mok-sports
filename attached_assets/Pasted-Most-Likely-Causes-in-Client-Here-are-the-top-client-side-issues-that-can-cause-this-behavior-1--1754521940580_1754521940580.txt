Most Likely Causes in Client:
Here are the top client-side issues that can cause this behavior:

1. Bad useEffect or cleanup logic
A useEffect hook may:

Establish the WebSocket

But then immediately call .close() in the cleanup or after a re-render

Example:

ts
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  const socket = new WebSocket('wss://...');
  return () => socket.close(); // ← called too early
}, []); // or missing correct deps
➡️ Verify the socket isn't being closed by a stale cleanup or rerender.

2. readyState check or premature event handler logic
You might be trying to send or read before the socket is OPEN

Or handling onclose or onerror in a way that triggers disconnects

➡️ Log the full lifecycle: onopen, onmessage, onclose, onerror

3. Invalid wss:// URL formatting
If the URL is incorrectly constructed:

wss://undefined or wss://[object Object] can cause silent failures

Especially if using template literals from env vars or route params

➡️ Print/log the exact WebSocket URL being passed in.

4. Missing auth or required query params
If the server expects something like:

ts
Copy
Edit
wss://example.com/ws/draft?userId=123&draftId=abc
and it’s missing or malformed, the server might accept but immediately close.

➡️ Double-check query params from the client match what the server expects.

5. Dev server Hot Reload (Vite/React) restarting
If your frontend is hot-reloading, it can reset the WebSocket connection rapidly.

➡️ Try testing the production build (vite build) to rule out hot reload interference.

6. Client throws uncaught error on onmessage
Example: your code expects JSON.parse() but receives a malformed message → throws → React unmounts or crashes → socket closes

➡️ Wrap all WebSocket message handling in try/catch.

✅ What to do next:
To isolate and confirm the issue, try:

ts
Copy
Edit
// Minimal working example (can be tested in a separate component)
useEffect(() => {
  const ws = new WebSocket('wss://your-app.repl.co/ws/draft?userId=123&draftId=abc');

  ws.onopen = () => console.log('[WS] Connected');
  ws.onmessage = (msg) => console.log('[WS] Message:', msg.data);
  ws.onclose = (e) => console.log('[WS] Disconnected:', e);
  ws.onerror = (e) => console.error('[WS] Error:', e);

  return () => ws.close();
}, []);
