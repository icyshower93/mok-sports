Great—so the SW/versioning fix worked, and the remaining crash is a runtime TDZ from a circular import that only surfaces right after auth when the app flips from login → authed routes. The agent’s “comment out useAuth” hack is only masking it. Let’s actually break the cycle cleanly.

Below is a surgical, copy-pasteable plan that works even if we don’t enumerate every file in your repo.

Why this is happening (quickly)

When module A imports B and B (directly or via barrels) imports A, one side tries to read a binding (in minified output it’s c) before it’s initialized → ReferenceError: Cannot access 'c' before initialization. Auth makes it deterministic because a different tree of pages mounts right after auth and finishes evaluating the offending modules.

Common causes:

Barrel files (index.ts) that re-export everything (hooks, stores, pages) and accidentally tie layers together.

useAuth living in a folder that also re-exports components or router constructs which import pages that import useAuth again.

Router files importing pages synchronously, while those pages (or their nested components) import back into router/store/auth.

Permanent fix (do these in order)
1) Detect cycles so you can confirm you’re done

Add a dev tool that yells when cycles exist.

# add once
npm i -D madge

# run whenever you want to see cycles
npx madge client/src --circular


If you want it to fail a build locally:

npx madge client/src --circular --warning


(You can also add eslint-plugin-import with import/no-cycle: "error", but Madge gives cleaner graphs fast.)

2) Kill the barrels that blend layers

Search for re-exports and convert them to direct imports.

# find barrels
rg -n "export \* from ['\"][^'\"]+['\"]" client/src | sort
rg -n "export {[^}]+} from ['\"][^'\"]+['\"]" client/src | sort


Typical offenders:

client/src/hooks/index.ts

client/src/pages/index.ts

client/src/features/*/index.ts

client/src/store/index.ts

Action: delete/trim these barrels or make them feature-scoped (see next step). Never have a barrel that re-exports both hooks/stores and pages/router from the same file.

3) Isolate auth into its own feature folder (no app imports!)

Create / enforce this structure:

client/src/features/auth/
  AuthContext.tsx
  AuthProvider.tsx
  useAuth.ts
  index.ts            // exports ONLY from this folder, nothing app-level


Sample minimal files (adapt to your current logic; these imports must be “leafy”—no pages/router here):

// client/src/features/auth/AuthContext.tsx
import { createContext } from "react";

export type AuthValue = {
  user: { id: string } | null;
  token: string | null;
  loading: boolean;
  // add other primitives, funcs as needed
};

export const AuthContext = createContext<AuthValue>({
  user: null,
  token: null,
  loading: true,
});

// client/src/features/auth/useAuth.ts
import { useContext } from "react";
import { AuthContext } from "./AuthContext";

export function useAuth() {
  return useContext(AuthContext);
}

// client/src/features/auth/AuthProvider.tsx
import { useEffect, useMemo, useState, type ReactNode } from "react";
import { AuthContext, type AuthValue } from "./AuthContext";
// import your API/client here (must not import any pages/router)

export function AuthProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<AuthValue["user"]>(null);
  const [token, setToken] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // put your existing token/user bootstrap here
    // setUser(...); setToken(...); setLoading(false);
  }, []);

  const value = useMemo<AuthValue>(() => ({ user, token, loading }), [user, token, loading]);

  return <AuthContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</AuthContext.Provider>;
}

// client/src/features/auth/index.ts
export * from "./useAuth";
export * from "./AuthProvider";
export * from "./AuthContext";
// IMPORTANT: export ONLY files inside this folder.


Now ensure none of these files import from @/pages, @/router, @/app, or any barrel that does.

4) Make routes lazy to cut sync edges

Synchronous page imports often complete a cycle. Switch to lazy:

// client/src/router.tsx
import { createBrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import { lazy } from "react";
import { RequireAuth } from "./components/RequireAuth"; // tiny gate component
// ^ this component may use useAuth, but must not import router or pages dynamically

const Dashboard = lazy(() => import("./pages/dashboard"));
const Profile   = lazy(() => import("./pages/profile"));
// ... repeat for authed pages

export const router = createBrowserRouter([
  { path: "/", element: <Landing /> }, // can be lazy too
  {
    path: "/app",
    element: <RequireAuth><AppShell /></RequireAuth>, // AppShell shouldn’t import router/pages
    children: [
      { path: "dashboard", element: <Dashboard /> },
      { path: "profile",   element: <Profile />   },
      // ...
    ],
  },
]);


A simple RequireAuth:

// client/src/components/RequireAuth.tsx
import { Navigate, useLocation } from "react-router-dom";
import { useAuth } from "@/features/auth";

export function RequireAuth({ children }: { children: React.ReactElement }) {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth();
  const loc = useLocation();
  if (loading) return null; // or a spinner
  return user ? children : <Navigate to="/login" state={{ from: loc }} replace />;
}

5) Ensure the entry is one-way: Providers → Router

Your entry should provide contexts then mount the router. The provider tree must not import pages/router.

// client/src/AppProviders.tsx
import { AuthProvider } from "@/features/auth";
// add other providers (QueryClientProvider, ThemeProvider...) here
export function AppProviders({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <AuthProvider>{children}</AuthProvider>;
}

// client/src/main.tsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
import { AppProviders } from "./AppProviders";
import { router } from "./router";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <AppProviders>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </AppProviders>
);

6) Replace barrel imports of useAuth with direct feature import

If any page/component imports from a generic barrel (like @/hooks), rewrite to the feature path to avoid that barrel re-export glue.

# search where useAuth comes from
rg -n "import\\s*{\\s*useAuth\\s*}.*['\\\"]@/.*['\\\"]" client/src

# quick codemod idea (review diffs!)
# replace from "@/hooks" or "@/whatever" to "@/features/auth"
sed -i '' 's|from "@/hooks"|from "@/features/auth"|g' $(rg -l 'from "@/hooks"' client/src)

# Repeat for any other alias path that re-exported useAuth

7) Rebuild, then confirm no cycles
npx madge client/src --circular
npm run build


Then hard-refresh and verify in DevTools:

SW shows /sw.js?v=<real-hash> (you already have this ✅)

No TDZ crash

Console clean

8) Guardrails (optional but recommended)

A. ESLint rule
Add to your ESLint config:

"plugins": ["import"],
"rules": {
  "import/no-cycle": ["error", { "ignoreExternal": true }],
  "import/no-internal-modules": ["warn", { "forbid": ["@/pages/**"] }]
}


(Adjust to your code style.)

B. CI check

{
  "scripts": {
    "check:cycles": "madge client/src --circular"
  }
}

If you still see the error

Now that SW caching and route lazy-loading are fixed, any remaining TDZ is almost certainly a single concrete cycle. Run:

npx madge client/src --circular --json > cycles.json


Open cycles.json and post the cycle paths; I’ll tell you exactly which import line to move. 99% of the time it’s one of:

a page importing useAuth from a global barrel that also re-exports router/pages,

a store importing router (or vice-versa),

a shared “layout” importing pages that import the layout back (move layout to components/ and keep it page-agnostic).

TL;DR

You fixed the SW; good.

Now split auth into its own feature folder, delete global barrels, and lazy-load pages from the router.

Replace all useAuth imports to come from @/features/auth.

Verify with Madge that cycles are gone.

Do those and the px TDZ crash will stop for good.
