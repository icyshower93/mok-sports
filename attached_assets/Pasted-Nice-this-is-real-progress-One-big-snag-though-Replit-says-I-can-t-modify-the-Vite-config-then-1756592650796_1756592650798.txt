Nice—this is real progress. One big snag though:

Replit says “I can’t modify the Vite config,” then later celebrates “vite-tsconfig-paths added.” Merely installing the package does nothing unless it’s actually added to vite.config.ts. If the plugin isn’t active, alias + relative paths can still produce duplicate modules, and the TDZ (“Cannot access 'c' before initialization”) can persist.

Here’s how to finish this off cleanly.

1) Make sure the plugin is actually enabled

Open vite.config.ts and confirm you see both of these lines:

import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    tsconfigPaths(), // ← this must be here
  ],
  build: {
    sourcemap: true,  // temporary: helps map the TDZ to real files
    minify: false     // temporary: avoids reordering masking the bug
  }
});


If it’s not there, add it and rebuild. (You can turn sourcemap and minify back to normal after you verify a clean run.)

2) Verify the barrel removal didn’t leave stragglers

You removed client/src/features/auth/index.ts. Great. Now make sure no file still imports the directory:

# should return nothing
rg -n "from ['\"]@/features/auth['\"]" client/src


If any remain, point them to the concrete files:

@/features/auth/useAuth

@/features/auth/AuthProvider

@/features/auth/AuthContext (use import type { ... } when it’s only types)

Also scan for any other barrels that re-export values (not just types) and remove/inline them:

rg -n "export \* from|export {.*} from" client/src

3) Eliminate duplicate imports (alias vs relative)

Mixed paths to the same module cause two copies to initialize in different orders:

# find alias imports
rg -n "from ['\"]@/" client/src > /tmp/alias.txt
# find relative parent imports
rg -n "from ['\"]\.\./" client/src > /tmp/rel.txt


Pick one style (I recommend the alias after enabling the plugin) and normalize any offenders so every import of a given module is identical.

4) Convert type-only imports

Anywhere a symbol is only used as a type, switch to import type so it vanishes at runtime (breaks TDZ edges):

// before
import { User } from '@/features/auth/AuthContext';
// after
import type { User } from '@/features/auth/AuthContext';

5) Defer risky singletons

If any module does work at import time that depends on another module’s values (creating clients, starting sockets, reading config), wrap it:

let _client: Client | null = null;
export function getClient() {
  if (!_client) _client = createClient(...);
  return _client;
}
// call getClient() inside effects/handlers, not at top-level

6) Rebuild cleanly and confirm the stack maps to source
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm i
npm run build


If the TDZ still fires, with sourcemap:true + minify:false the stack will show the real file & line instead of hx/c. Fix that exact import edge.
