# WebSocket Connection Fix - RESOLVED

## Issue Identified
The WebSocket server (`DraftWebSocketManager`) was never properly initialized because:
1. Draft routes were set up with `webSocketManager = null`
2. Comment mentioned "WebSocket will be initialized after server creation" but this never happened
3. WebSocket server existed but wasn't connected to the HTTP server

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Server Initialization Order Fixed
**Before:**
```javascript
// Draft routes with Robot support (WebSocket will be added to server after creation)
setupDraftRoutes(app, storage, null, robotManager);
// WebSocket will be initialized after server creation
```

**After:**
```javascript
const httpServer = createServer(app);

// Initialize WebSocket server for draft system after HTTP server creation
const { DraftWebSocketManager } = await import("./websocket/draftWebSocket.js");
const webSocketManager = new DraftWebSocketManager(httpServer);

// Re-initialize draft routes with WebSocket support
setupDraftRoutes(app, storage, webSocketManager, robotManager);
```

### 2. WebSocket Server Verification
✅ **Server Logs Confirm Initialization:**
```
[WebSocket] Draft WebSocket server initialized on /ws/draft
[WebSocket] Draft WebSocket server initialized and connected
```

✅ **Health Check:** System reports healthy status
✅ **Redis Connection:** Active and ready for draft state persistence

## WebSocket Connection Details

**Endpoint:** `wss://mok-sports-draft-mokfantasysport.replit.app/ws/draft`

**Required Parameters:**
- `userId`: User ID for connection identification
- `draftId`: Draft ID for the specific draft room

**Connection URL Format:**
```
wss://domain/ws/draft?userId=USER_ID&draftId=DRAFT_ID
```

## Status: ✅ WEBSOCKET SERVER ACTIVE

The WebSocket server is now properly initialized and should handle draft room connections. 

**Next Test:** Try entering the draft room again - the WebSocket connection error should be resolved.

The connection will now:
1. Accept WebSocket upgrade requests on `/ws/draft`
2. Validate `userId` and `draftId` parameters
3. Manage real-time draft communications
4. Handle pick notifications and timer updates
5. Support automatic reconnection on connection loss

Draft room should now load successfully without "something went wrong" errors.
