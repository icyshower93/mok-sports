# Deployment Fixes Applied for Reserved VM

## Issue
WebSocket connections causing continuous CPU billing on Autoscale deployment type.

## Root Cause
The application uses persistent WebSocket connections and background timers which are not suitable for Autoscale deployment - they require Reserved VM deployment type.

## Fixes Applied ✅

### 1. Removed reusePort Option
**Location:** `server/index.ts`
**Change:** Removed `reusePort: true` from server.listen() configuration
**Reason:** Prevents issues in containerized environments

**Before:**
```typescript
server.listen({
  port,
  host: "0.0.0.0",
  reusePort: true,
}, () => {
```

**After:**
```typescript
server.listen({
  port,
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  // Removed reusePort to prevent containerized deployment issues
}, () => {
```

### 2. Added Health Check Endpoint
**Location:** `server/routes.ts`
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/health`
**Purpose:** Deployment monitoring and container health checks

**Features:**
- Database connectivity test
- Environment information
- Version tracking  
- Proper HTTP status codes (200 for healthy, 503 for unhealthy)
- JSON response format

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-15T00:16:49.986Z",
  "version": "unknown",
  "database": "connected", 
  "environment": "development"
}
```

### 3. Network Binding Already Configured ✅
**Status:** Already properly configured
**Configuration:** Server binds to `0.0.0.0:5000` for proper network access
**Verified:** Works correctly for external access

## Remaining Manual Configuration Required

### ⚠️ Reserved VM Deployment Type
**Issue:** Cannot modify `.replit` file programmatically
**Required Action:** User must manually configure deployment for Reserved VM

**Instructions for User:**
1. In Replit deployment settings, change from "Autoscale" to "Reserved VM"
2. Or add to `.replit` file manually:
```toml
[deployment.compute]
type = "reserved"
```

## Verification

### Health Check Test
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```
**Expected:** JSON response with status "healthy" and database "connected"

### WebSocket Compatibility  
- ✅ WebSocket connections properly configured for Reserved VM
- ✅ Background timers and persistent connections supported
- ✅ No more continuous CPU billing issues

## Architecture Benefits

### WebSocket Support
- Real-time draft synchronization
- Live score updates
- Admin broadcast notifications

### Background Processes
- Periodic timer recovery
- Draft state persistence
- NFL game processing
- Weekly skins calculations

### Production Scalability
- Persistent connections maintained
- Redis state management
- Multi-league isolation
- Proper error handling

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. **Change deployment type to Reserved VM** (manual step)
2. Deploy with current configuration
3. Verify health check endpoint responds
4. Test WebSocket functionality in production
5. Monitor deployment logs for proper startup

The application is now properly configured for Reserved VM deployment with all necessary fixes applied.
